## 📌 What’s Inside

### SQL Scripts

Each script addresses an analytical need by writing SQL that runs against your data warehouse:

- **Exploratory analysis (`analytics/…`)** — overview metrics, distributions, and initial investigation results. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Advanced analytics (`analytics/…`)** — deeper insights using window functions, ranking, and trend analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **Customer reporting (`data_report/data_report_customers.sql`)** — customer segmentation, lifetime value, recency/frequency insights. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- **Product reporting (`data_report/data_report_products.sql`)** — product performance, revenue drivers, and catalog trends. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. **Connect your SQL environment** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Databricks SQL).  
2. **Ensure the data warehouse schema is loaded** with fact and dimension tables.  
3. **Open and run the SQL files** to generate views or summary tables.  
4. **Inspect result sets** to explore business insights.

This project assumes you already have a structured data warehouse in place — the focus here is on *analysis* rather than data ingestion. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## 📈 Future Improvements

Ideas you could build on:

- Add **visual dashboards** in Power BI, Tableau, or Python notebooks.  
- Automate analytics via scheduled jobs or ETL pipelines.  
- Publish sample datasets and results for easier experimentation.
