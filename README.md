# 📊 Data Analytics Project

This repository contains SQL scripts that perform exploratory and advanced analysis on a sales data warehouse I designed and built. The goal is to demonstrate real-world analytics workflows — from data exploration and KPI computation to product and customer performance reporting.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

### 📁 Files & Scripts

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `exploratory_data_analysis.sql` | Initial exploration and basic business metrics. |
| `advanced_data_analytics.sql` | Trend analysis using window functions, running totals, and time series logic. |
| `data_report_customers.sql` | Customer-level reporting with segmentation based on spending behavior and recency. |
| `data_report_products.sql` | Product performance reporting — revenue, order volume, lifespan, and performance classification. |

These scripts run against a structured data warehouse schema with fact and dimension tables.
