# Data Analytics Project

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics** on a simulated sales data warehouse. It includes **database modeling, star schema design, data population, automated business logic, and analytical queries** to generate actionable business insights. This showcases practical skills required for a data analyst role.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Star Schema Design**:  
  - Fact table: `orders` / `order_details`  
  - Dimension tables: `customers`, `products`  
  - Enables scalable and efficient analytics, just like in a real data warehouse.

- **SQL Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Table creation, relationships, triggers, stored procedures, and functions  
  - Aggregations, joins, window functions, and analytical queries  
  - End-to-end workflow: data modeling → data population → automated logic → insights  

- **Key Analytical Queries**:  
  - Total order amounts per customer  
  - Monthly sales trends per product  
  - Best-selling products and units sold  
  - Customers with no orders  
  - Inventory status (low stock / sold-out products)

## 📈 Future Improvements

Ideas you could build on:

- Add **visual dashboards** in Power BI, Tableau, or Python notebooks.  
- Automate analytics via scheduled jobs or ETL pipelines.  
- Publish sample datasets and results for easier experimentation.
